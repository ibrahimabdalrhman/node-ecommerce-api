# node-ecommerce-api

This project is a Node.js based eCommerce API that can be used as a back-end solution for an online store. It uses MongoDB as a database and provides a number of endpoints for handling products, orders, users, and authentication.
## Getting Started


To use this API, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.



## Testing with Postman
A collection of endpoints has been created for testing with Postman. You can find the collection at this [link]( https://gold-zodiac-94817.postman.co/workspace/New-Team-Workspace~603a9d2a-808e-41e5-ba60-c4cdb277bb82/collection/23276008-9b53ae83-bb26-4a94-822b-7811e658ee4b?action=share&creator=27173409).
